# Parsley ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/j-mie6/parsley/CI) ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/j-mie6/parsley?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/j-mie6/parsley.svg)](https://github.com/j-mie6/parsley/blob/master/LICENSE)

## What is Parsley?
Parsley is a very fast parser combinator library for Scala based on a Haskell-style Parsec API.

## How do I use it?

Parsley is distributed on Maven Central, and can be added to your project via:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.j-mie6" %% "parsley" % PARSLEY_VER
```

Documentation can be found [**here**](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.j-mie6/parsley_2.13/latest/index.html)

### Examples

```scala
import parsley.Parsley, Parsley._
import parsley.character.{char, string, digit}
import parsley.implicits.{charLift, stringLift}

val hello: Parsley[Unit] = void('h' *> ("ello" <|> "i") *> " world!")
hello.parse("hello world!") // returns Success(())
hello.parse("hi world!") // returns Success(())
hello.parse("hey world!") // returns a Failure

val natural: Parsley[Int] = digit.foldLeft1(0)((n, d) => n * 10 + d.asDigit)
natural.parse("0") // returns Success(0)
natural.parse("123") // returns Success(123)
```

### What are the differences to Haskell's Parsec?
Mostly, this library is quite similar. However, due to Scala's differences in operator characters a few operators are changed:

* `(<$>)` is known as `<#>` or `map`
* `try` is known as `attempt`
* `(<$)` and `($>)` are `<#` and `#>` respectively.

In addition, `lift2` and `lift3` are uncurried in this library: this is to provide better performance and easier usage with
Scala's traditionally uncurried functions. There are also a few new operators in general to be found here!

## How does it work?
Parsley represents parsers as an abstract-syntax tree AST, which is constructed lazily. As a result, Parsley is able to
perform analysis and optimisations on your parsers, which helps reduce the burden on you, the programmer. This representation
is then compiled into a light-weight stack-based instruction set designed to run fast on the JVM. This is what offers Parsley
its competitive performance, but for best effect a parser should be compiled once and used many times (so-called hot execution).

To make recursive parsers work in this AST format, you must ensure that recursion is done by knot-tying: you should define all
recursive parsers with `val` and introduce `lazy val` where necessary for the compiler to accept the definition.

## Bug Reports [![Percentage of issues still open](https://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/j-mie6/Parsley.svg)](https://isitmaintained.com/project/j-mie6/Parsley "Percentage of issues still open") [![Maintainability](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/maintainability/j-mie6/Parsley)](https://codeclimate.com/github/j-mie6/Parsley) [![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/coverage-letter/j-mie6/Parsley)](https://codeclimate.com/github/j-mie6/Parsley)

If you encounter a bug when using Parsley, try and minimise the example of the parser (and the input) that triggers the bug.
If possible, make a self contained example: this will help me to identify the issue without too much issue.
